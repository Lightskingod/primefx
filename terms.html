                                using third party or anonymous funds will not be made available to the Client. P. Agrees
                                that in case the Company carries out a transaction/Operation on his/her behalf which is
                                not covered by the balance of his/her Account, the Company shall have the right to

                                Client may suffer due to such deficiencies.</p>

                            <p class="left black">R. Acknowledges that the Company has the right to refuse to execute
